# Diabetes-Classification-using-KNN-Algorithm

In this, We are given a Diabetes Data set consisting of following features -

['Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', 'Outcome']

and the task is to predict whether a person is suffering from diabetes or not (Binary Classification).

Person is classified as 0 or 1 (Diabetic or Not) using K-Nearest Neighbors classifier(KNN).

The Dataset are two .csv Files that are provided.
1. Diabetes_XTrain.csv - It consists of 576 Rows and 8 Columns(Features)
2. Diabetes_YTrain.csv - It consists of 576 Rows and 1 Column (That contains Result)

The max Accuracy that could be achieved was 70 %.

To run the code, please make sure that the latest version of Python, Jupyter and aforementioned libraries are installed in your system.
